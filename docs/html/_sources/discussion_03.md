# 3. Agenda

- **Questions about Discussion 2 topics?**
- While going through the following notebooks, be sure to demo the features of using the Python and Jupyter extensions within VS Code.
    - Overview: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/overview
    - Variable explorer and data viewer: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks#_variable-explorer-and-data-viewer
    - Custom notebook diffing: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks#_custom-notebook-diffing
- [**Overview of the PyData Stack**](./_notebook_build/_03_overview_of_pydata_stack.ipynb): We'll go over the various libraries that we'll be using in this course. This includes NumPy, SciPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.
- [**Comparison of Plotting Libraries In Python**](./_notebook_build/_03_comparing_plotting_libraries.ipynb)
- **Optional review of using `interact` in Jupyter Notebooks.** We're not going to cover it, but those that are interested can learn more about how to use it [here.](./_notebook_build/_03_Using_Interact.ipynb)
- [**Python by Example**](./_notebook_build/_03_python_by_example.ipynb): We'll go through some examples of Python basics: basic control-flow, functions, and classes.
- [**Start Homework 2 Together**](./_notebook_build/_HW2-numpy-scipy.ipynb): We'll start working on Homework 2. This homework will be due before the next class. It will not be graded, but it will be a good way to get started with the material.
- **Individual Help with Setup.** Save 30-45 minutes at the end to help students individually with their setup.

## Homework

Please complete the following:
- [**Homework 2**](./_notebook_build/_HW2-numpy-scipy.ipynb): We'll start working on Homework 2. This homework will be due before the next class. It will not be graded, but it will be a good way to get started with the material.

Please read the following:
- Introduction to [NumPy](https://python-programming.quantecon.org/numpy.html)
- Introduction to [Matplotlib](https://python-programming.quantecon.org/matplotlib.html)
- Compare Matplotlib to other plotting libraries: [./src/comparing_plotting_libraries.ipynb](./_notebook_build/_03_comparing_plotting_libraries.ipynb)
- Introduction to [SciPy](https://python-programming.quantecon.org/scipy.html)
