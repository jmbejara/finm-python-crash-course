FINM August Python Introduction and Review: Week 2
==================================================

Agenda

  - Follow-up on previous assignment: Installation of software on the main [README](https://github.com/jmbejara/finm-python-crash-course/blob/main/README.md)
    - Today we will use Jupyter locally to do all of our coding. We will use Jupyter notebooks. Next week we will use notebooks within VS Code. The week after than we will move away from notebooks and write `.py` files directly.
    - Review QuantEcon lecture of [Local Installation](https://datascience.quantecon.org/introduction/local_install.html)
    - Discuss using the terminal/command prompt, folder structure, Python vs Anaconda, Anaconda vs Conda, Google Colab vs locally-running Jupyter server, Jupyter Notebooks vs VS Code.
  - Continue with introductory Python topics:
    - To learn about "Control Flow", let's use the ["Introductory Example" or "Python by Example"](https://python-programming.quantecon.org/python_by_example.html) notebook found here: [./python_by_example.ipynb](./python_by_example.ipynb)
    - Now, we'll learn more about functions using the ["Functions"](https://datascience.quantecon.org/python_fundamentals/functions.html) chapter found here: [./functions.ipynb](./functions.ipynb)
  - Start learning the basics of the Numpy, Matplotlib, and Scipy
    - Introduction to [NumPy](https://python-programming.quantecon.org/numpy.html)
    - Introduction to [Matplotlib](https://python-programming.quantecon.org/matplotlib.html)
    - Introduction to [SciPy](https://python-programming.quantecon.org/scipy.html)
  - Homework for next time: See HW 1 folder. These are a series of short exercises to practice using NumPy and SciPy
