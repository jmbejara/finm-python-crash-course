## How do these compare with Bloomberg or Datastream?

Choosing between financial databases like CRSP, Bloomberg, or Datastream depends on the specific requirements of the research or analysis being conducted. Each of these platforms has unique strengths and features that make them suitable for different purposes. Here are some reasons why someone might opt for CRSP over Bloomberg or Datastream:

- **Historical Depth:** CRSP is renowned for its extensive historical data, particularly for U.S. securities. It offers data going back as far as 1925, which is invaluable for long-term historical research and analysis. This level of historical depth might not be matched by Bloomberg or Datastream.
- **Survivorship Bias-Free Data:** CRSP's data includes companies that have ceased to exist, which is crucial for accurate historical analyses. This feature helps in avoiding survivorship bias, making it a robust choice for academic studies that require comprehensive historical perspectives.
- **Data Consistency and Quality:** CRSP is known for its high standards in data accuracy, consistency, and cleanliness, which are critical for reliable academic research.

On the other hand, there are some drawbacks of CRSP relative to Bloomberg or Datastream.

- **Limited Scope**: CRSP has a limited scope relative to Bloomberg or Datastream. It primarily focuses on US markets and lacks the global coverage found in Bloomberg.
- **Real-Time Data**: Does not offer real-time data, which is essential for current market analysis.
- **Less Comprehensive**: Fewer types of financial data compared to Bloomberg (e.g., lacks extensive international data, commodities, real-time news).

Broadly speaking, CRSP is more suited for academic research focused on historical analysis of the U.S. stock market, offering in-depth and high-quality data with a bias-free historical perspective. Bloomberg, on the other hand, excels in providing a wide range of real-time global financial data and tools, catering more to finance professionals and analysts who require real-time data and sophisticated analysis tools. The choice between them largely depends on the specific needs, goals, and resources of the user.

## WRDS Web Queries

To familiarize yourselves to using WRDS, please [watch the following video](https://vimeo.com/436447434) about WRDS Web Queries. While we will be automating the query process using the WRDS Python package [`wrds`](https://pypi.org/project/wrds/), using the web query system is a good way for initial exploration of the data.
