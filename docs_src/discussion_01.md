# 1. Agenda

## Agenda

- Introduction: Who am I? What's the goal of this review?
- **Course Page on GitHub**
    - Review course page on GitHub: https://github.com/jmbejara/finm-python-crash-course
    - Course textbook: https://jeremybejarano.com/finm-python-crash-course/
- [**Set up Environment**](./01_setting_up_environment.md): Today we will make sure that everyone has their computational environment set
up correctly. This includes Python (via the Anaconda distribution), Visual
Studio Code, Git and GitHub, and a WRDS class count for this course.
- [**Various Method of Interacting with Python**](./01_methods_for_using_python.md): Throughout the course, we'll
discuss the various ways of interacting with Python: Google Collab, Jupyter
Notebooks through the standard Jupyter server, Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code,
using IPython in the command line, and running Python scripts directly from the
command line (`.py` files).
- **Individual Help with Setup.** Save the last half of the discussion to help students individually with their setup.
This is an important purpose of this August review. It is most useful if it is interactive and if students can get one-on-one help before
the school year starts.

## Homework 

- [**Homework 1**](./HW1.md) Do this on your own after class. 
Finish setting up your environment. Learn about VS Code and Git on your own.
