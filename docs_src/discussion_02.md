# 2. Agenda
  
- Questions about HW1? Did anyone attempt?
- Follow-up on previous assignment, HW 0: Installation of software on the main
    [README](https://github.com/jmbejara/finm-python-crash-course/blob/main/README.md)
    - Today we will use Jupyter locally to do all of our coding. We will use
      Jupyter notebooks. Next week we will use notebooks within VS Code. The
      week after than we will move away from notebooks and write `.py` files
      directly.
    - Did anyone have any trouble installing Anaconda and VS Code? Share screen
      if there are issues.
    - Review HW 2 from last time.
    - Who tried the HW? Any questions?
    - Show location of solutions notebook.
- What are some gotcha's when using Jupyter notebooks?
    - What is the terminal/command prompt? What is bash?
    - Spin up Jupyter notebook. Show how it can't go above the root folder.
    - Discuss the importance of maintaining a reasonable folder structure.
      Folder for all course work, separate folder for each course, for each
      project, etc.
    - Google Colab vs locally-running Jupyter server, Jupyter Notebooks vs VS
      Code
    - Difference between Python and Anaconda?
    - Difference between Anaconda and Conda.
    - Demo the use of conda for installing packages and using conda
      environments.
    - What is the purpose of a conda environment?
- Skim over the [./src/02_Using_Interact.ipynb](./_notebook_build/_02_Using_Interact.ipynb)
    - We're not going to cover it, but those that are interested can learn more
      about how to use it here. 
- Continue with introductory Python topics:
    - To learn about "Control Flow" in the context of generating pseudo-random
      time series, let's use the ["Introductory Example" or "Python by
      Example"](https://python-programming.quantecon.org/python_by_example.html)
      notebook found here:
      [./src/01_python_by_example.ipynb](./_notebook_build/_01_python_by_example.ipynb)
- Start with discussion of Pandas. Start going over the Pandas chapter from
    ["Python Data Science
    Handbook"](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook)
    - `02_00-Introduction-to-Pandas.ipynb`
    - `02_01-Introducing-Pandas-Objects.ipynb`
    - `02_02-Data-Indexing-and-Selection.ipynb`
    - Break for an set of in-class exercises:
      [./src/02_occupations.ipynb](./_notebook_build/_02_occupations.ipynb)
    - `02_03-Operations-in-Pandas.ipynb`
    - `02_04-Missing-Values.ipynb`
- Homework for next time: See HW 2 folder. These are a series of short exercises
    to practice using Pandas.
