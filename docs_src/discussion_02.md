# 2. Agenda

## Agenda

- [**Sync Changes from GitHub and a Brief Overview of Git Concepts**](./syncing_files_with_git_and_github.md): We'll go over how to sync changes from GitHub and a brief overview of Git concepts.
- **Install Necessary Python Packages**. If you haven't done so already, make sure to run the following command in your terminal to install the necessary packages for this course: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- [**Overview of the PyData Stack**](./_notebook_build/_02_overview_of_pydata_stack.ipynb): We'll go over the
various libraries that we'll be using in this course. This includes NumPy,
SciPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.
- [**Comparison of Plotting Libraries In Python**](./_notebook_build/_02_comparing_plotting_libraries.ipynb)
- **Optional review of using `interact` in Jupyter Notebooks.** We're not going to cover it, but those that are interested can learn more about how to use it [here.](./_notebook_build/_02_Using_Interact.ipynb)
- [**Python by Example**](./_notebook_build/_02_python_by_example.ipynb): We'll go through some examples of Python basics: basic control-flow, functions, and classes.
- [**Start Homework 2 Together**](./_notebook_build/_HW2-numpy-scipy.ipynb): We'll start working on Homework 1. This homework will be due before the next class. It will not be graded, but it will be a good way to get started with the material.
- **Individual Help with Setup.** Save 30-45 minutes at the end to help students individually with their setup.

## Homework

Please complete the following:
- [**Homework 2**](./_notebook_build/_HW2-numpy-scipy.ipynb): We'll start working on Homework 1. This homework will be due before the next class. It will not be graded, but it will be a good way to get started with the material.

Please read the following:
- Introduction to [NumPy](https://python-programming.quantecon.org/numpy.html)
- Introduction to [Matplotlib](https://python-programming.quantecon.org/matplotlib.html)
- Compare Matplotlib to other plotting libraries: [./src/comparing_plotting_libraries.ipynb](./_notebook_build/_02_comparing_plotting_libraries.ipynb)
- Introduction to [SciPy](https://python-programming.quantecon.org/scipy.html)
