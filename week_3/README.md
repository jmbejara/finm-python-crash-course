FINM August Python Introduction and Review: Week 3
==================================================

Agenda

  - Today we will use notebooks within VS Code. We'll also begin the discussion of writing `.py` files directly. The week after that we will move away from notebooks entirely. 
  - Discuss the features of using the Python and Jupyter extensions within VS Code.
    - Overview: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/overview
    - Variable explorer and data viewer: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks#_variable-explorer-and-data-viewer
    - Custom notebook diffing: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks#_custom-notebook-diffing
  - Demonstration of Git and GitHub
    - VS Code especially makes Git diffs of Jupyter notebooks easy. Demonstrate why they are otherwise difficult.
  - Finish discussion of Pandas from previous lecture:
    - Set of in-class exercises: [./occupations.ipynb](./occupations.ipynb)
    - `03.03-Operations-in-Pandas.ipynb`
    - `03.04-Missing-Values.ipynb`
  - Demonstrate Pandas in the context of factor analysis/principal components analysis of a panel (Note from 2023. Ran out of time at the beginning of discussing this notebook.)
  of economic and financial time series. [./factor_analysis_demo.ipynb](./factor_analysis_demo.ipynb)
  - Very quick review of Numpy, Matplotlib, and Scipy, with emphasis on plotting
    - Introduction to [NumPy](https://python-programming.quantecon.org/numpy.html)
    - Introduction to [Matplotlib](https://python-programming.quantecon.org/matplotlib.html)
    - Compare Matplotlib to other plotting libraries: [./comparing_plotting_libraries.ipynb](./comparing_plotting_libraries.ipynb)
    - Introduction to [SciPy](https://python-programming.quantecon.org/scipy.html)
