    "# 2.7 CRSP Market Returns Indices\n",
    "\n",
    "The CRSP (Center for Research in Security Prices) dataset provides two indices\n",
    "for market returns: an equal-weighted index and a value-weighted index (both provided\n",
    "in terms of returns with and without dividends). The equal-weighted index\n",
    "computes the simple average of returns across stocks. This series is available as `EWRETD` and `EWRETX`, (with and without dividends, respectively).\n",
    "The value-Weighted Returns index represents a stock market index that calculates the return on investment by considering both the price changes and dividends of each component security, weighted by its market capitalization. This means that larger companies have a greater impact on the index's performance compared to smaller companies. The value-weighting approach aims to reflect the actual investment returns that an investor would achieve by holding a market portfolio, mirroring the performance of the overall market or specific market segments more accurately than equal-weighted indices. The CRSP indices are widely used in academic research and financial analysis to study market trends, evaluate investment strategies, and benchmark the performance of portfolios against the broader market. This series is available in the CRSP tables under the mnemonic `VWRETD` and `VWRETX` (with and without dividends, respectively).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this guide, we'll discuss the construction of the equal- and value-weighted market return indices. To construct these indices, we'll follow the suggestions here: https://wrds-www.wharton.upenn.edu/pages/support/support-articles/crsp/index-and-deciles/constructing-value-weighted-return-series-matches-vwretd-crsp-monthly-value-weighted-returns-includes-distributions/\n",

    "These suggestions boil down to the most important part: we must select the correct universe of stocks that comprise \"the market\"."
